# Brainstorm: SLA Calculator

## Core Functionality
- Client-side web tool hosted on GitHub Pages (no server dependencies)
- Predefined SLA tiers (e.g., 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%) with downtime breakdown by:
	- Minute
	- Hour
	- Day
	- Week
	- Month
	- Quarter
	- Year
- Custom SLA input field for arbitrary percentages with real-time calculation

## User Configuration
- Toggle weekend inclusion/exclusion
- Choose calculation window: 24/7 vs. configurable business hours
	- Workweek length (e.g., 40h/week)
	- Custom daily work hours and holiday list
- URL parameter support (`?sla=`) to prefill and auto-calculate

## UI/UX Considerations
- Minimalist, modern design: clean layout, subtle accents
- High-contrast, legible fonts (e.g., Inter, system UI)
- Responsive for desktop and mobile
- Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, color contrast)
- Ultra-lightweight: no heavy frameworks or assets

## Technical Notes
- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS (no build step required)
- Utility functions for date/time calculations
- Optionally include a small library (e.g., day.js) for formatting

## Enhancements & Extensions
- Time zone awareness (local vs. UTC)
- Leap year & daylight saving considerations
- Export results as CSV/JSON
- Dark mode toggle
- Localization (i18n) for labels/date formats
- Shareable deep links for configurations

## Future Directions
- Embeddable widget version for docs/dashboards
- Optional API wrapper for monitoring tool integration
- Historical SLA trend charts & visualizations
- Notifications/reminders for SLA threshold alerts
