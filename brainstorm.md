# Brainstorm: SLA Calculator

## Core Functionality
- Client-side web tool hosted on GitHub Pages (no server dependencies)
- Predefined SLA tiers (e.g., 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%) with downtime breakdown by:
	- Minute
	- Hour
	- Day
	- Week
	- Month
	- Quarter
	- Year
- Custom SLA input field for arbitrary percentages with real-time calculation

## User Configuration
- Toggle weekend inclusion/exclusion
- Choose calculation window: 24/7 vs. configurable business hours
	- Workweek length (e.g., 40h/week)
	- Custom daily work hours and holiday list
- URL parameter support (`?sla=`) to prefill and auto-calculate

## UI/UX Considerations
- Minimalist, modern design: clean layout, subtle accents
- High-contrast, legible fonts (e.g., Inter, system UI)
- Responsive for desktop and mobile
- Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, color contrast)
- Ultra-lightweight: no heavy frameworks or assets

## Technical Notes
- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS (no build step required)
- Utility functions for date/time calculations
- Optionally include a small library (e.g., day.js) for formatting

## Enhancements & Extensions
- Time zone awareness (local vs. UTC)
- Leap year & daylight saving considerations
- Export results as CSV/JSON
- Dark mode toggle
- Localization (i18n) for labels/date formats
- Shareable deep links for configurations

## Future Directions
- Embeddable widget version for docs/dashboards
- Optional API wrapper for monitoring tool integration
- Historical SLA trend charts & visualizations
- Notifications/reminders for SLA threshold alerts

# SLA Calculator Brainstorm

## Initial Ideas and Concepts

### Problem Statement
Organizations need to quickly calculate and understand SLA commitments, downtime allowances, and uptime requirements. Current tools are either too complex or require subscriptions.

### Target Audience
- DevOps engineers
- Site reliability engineers
- Service managers
- IT professionals
- Business stakeholders

### Key Use Cases
1. **SLA Planning**: Determine realistic uptime targets for new services
2. **Incident Response**: Calculate impact of downtime on SLA commitments
3. **Capacity Planning**: Understand maintenance windows within SLA constraints
4. **Reporting**: Generate SLA compliance reports
5. **Education**: Help teams understand the real impact of "nines" of uptime

### Potential Features (Brainstormed)
- [ ] Basic SLA percentage to downtime conversion
- [ ] Reverse calculation (downtime to SLA percentage)
- [ ] Multiple time period support
- [ ] Maintenance window calculator
- [ ] SLA budget tracker (year-to-date downtime)
- [ ] Incident impact calculator
- [ ] SLA comparison tool
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV
- [ ] Shareable links
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Calculator history
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] API for programmatic access
- [ ] Integration with monitoring tools

### Technical Considerations
- Keep it simple and fast
- No backend required initially
- Mobile-first design
- Accessible (WCAG compliant)
- SEO friendly for discoverability
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Competitive Analysis
- Existing SLA calculators are often part of larger monitoring suites
- Most are either too basic or overly complex
- Opportunity for a focused, user-friendly tool

### Success Metrics
- User engagement (time on site, calculations performed)
- GitHub stars and forks
- User feedback and feature requests
- Community contributions

## Next Steps
1. Create MVP with basic calculations
2. Gather user feedback
3. Iterate based on real usage patterns
4. Consider advanced features based on demand
