# SLA Calculator Brainstorm

## Initial Ideas and Concepts

### Problem Statement
Organizations need to quickly calculate and understand SLA commitments, downtime allowances, and uptime requirements. Current tools are either too complex or require subscriptions.

### Target Audience
- DevOps engineers
- Site reliability engineers
- Service managers
- IT professionals
- Business stakeholders

### Key Use Cases
1. **SLA Planning**: Determine realistic uptime targets for new services
2. **Incident Response**: Calculate impact of downtime on SLA commitments
3. **Capacity Planning**: Understand maintenance windows within SLA constraints
4. **Reporting**: Generate SLA compliance reports
5. **Education**: Help teams understand the real impact of "nines" of uptime

### Potential Features (Brainstormed)
- [ ] Basic SLA percentage to downtime conversion
- [ ] Reverse calculation (downtime to SLA percentage)
- [ ] Multiple time period support
- [ ] Maintenance window calculator
- [ ] SLA budget tracker (year-to-date downtime)
- [ ] Incident impact calculator
- [ ] SLA comparison tool
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV
- [ ] Shareable links
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Calculator history
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] API for programmatic access
- [ ] Integration with monitoring tools

### Technical Considerations
- Keep it simple and fast
- No backend required initially
- Mobile-first design
- Accessible (WCAG compliant)
- SEO friendly for discoverability
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Competitive Analysis
- Existing SLA calculators are often part of larger monitoring suites
- Most are either too basic or overly complex
- Opportunity for a focused, user-friendly tool

### Success Metrics
- User engagement (time on site, calculations performed)
- GitHub stars and forks
- User feedback and feature requests
- Community contributions

## Next Steps
1. Create MVP with basic calculations
2. Gather user feedback
3. Iterate based on real usage patterns
4. Consider advanced features based on demand
